                    <h1>Bulkley Emergency Support Services</h1>
                    <p>The Bulkley Emergency Support Services (ESS) team is one of the many community-based ESS teams throughout B.C. who provide services, on a short-term basis, to preserve the emotional and physical well-being of evacuees and response workers in emergency situations.</p>
                    <p>ESS are those services required to preserve the well-being of evacuees and response workers in emergency situations. The goal of ESS is to help people begin to re-establish themselves as quickly as possible after a disaster. ESS plays an important role in emergency management in BC by:</p>
                    <ul><li>Helping people meet their immediate basic needs during a disaster;</li>
                    <li>Reuniting families seperated by disaster and;</li>
                    <li>Providing people affected by a disaster with accurate and up-to-date information.</li></ul>
                    <p>ESS is generally available for up to 72 hours.  During these first 72 hours, evacuees should immediately plan their next steps by contacting their insurance agents, families and friends, or accessing other possible community resources.  ESS may be extended in exceptional circumstances only.</p>
                    <p>In BC, local authorities are responsible for planning and operating ESS as part of their overall emergency plan. More than 150 local governments in BC have an ESS team, with approximately 5,000 volunteers around the province donating their time and energy to support people affected by disaster. Many community ESS teams are also assisted by local government staff and non-government organizations in providing services. The province, through the Emergency Management BC, ESS Office, provides funding for short-term basic evacuee needs and assists local authorities by providing ESS support and training to volunteers and staff.</p>
